Crime Hotspot Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict crime hotspots using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical crime data, we build and compare predictive models using Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The goal is to identify areas with a high likelihood of crime occurrences, helping law enforcement agencies allocate resources more efficiently.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature selection, and normalization.
Data Analysis: Visualizing and understanding crime data trends and patterns.
Model Building: Implementing Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.
Model Evaluation: Comparing models using various metrics like accuracy.
Visualization: Mapping crime hotspots on a geographical map.
